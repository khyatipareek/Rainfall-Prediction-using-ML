# Rainfall-Prediction-using-ML
Variations in rainfall have a drastic effect on agriculture. Too much or too little rain (water) can
harm the crops and yields. Hence, predicting rainfall is essential for the effective use of water
resources for crops. It is very important to decrease agricultural loss.
The existing prediction methods are large and local based and sometimes they donâ€™t sense the
atmospheric parameters for specific regions. Whereas, our project focuses on building a system that
solves these problems and at the same time is transformed into a wearable cap as well which can be worn
by the farmers themselves. It automatically logs atmospheric parameters to the system. It is portable and
eases the work of the farmer.
A bad rainfall prediction can affect agriculture mostly farmers as their whole crop is dependent on
the rainfall and agriculture is always an important part of every economy. So, making an accurate
prediction of the rainfall is somewhat good. There are a number of techniques used in machine learning but
accuracy is always a matter of concern in predictions made about rainfall.
It will also improve weather prediction systems and there might be personalized apps to regulate
people in day-to-day life. These apps can be integrated into the working of organizations centered around
agriculture and other businesses related to it.
Since agriculture is often related to the economy of a country, accurate weather prediction will provide
great help to the lives of those directly involved in the processing as well as most other citizens.
